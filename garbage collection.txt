Methods & variables are created on stack memory

Objects & instance variables are created on heap memory

A new stack frame is created on invocation of a function\method and is destroyed on return.

Python calls in the background gc.collect() to removes dead objects that no longer have a reference.

Defining "__del__" method implements destructor via "del obj".
