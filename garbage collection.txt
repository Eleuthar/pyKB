Methods & variables are created on stack memory

Objects & instance variables are created on heap memory

A new stack frame is created on invocation of a function\method and is destroyed on return.

Defining "__del__" method implements destructor via "del obj".

Python counts the references then calls gc.collect to gather dead objects that no longer have a reference, reference counter ignoring weakref.

gc.finalize() triggers cleanup
