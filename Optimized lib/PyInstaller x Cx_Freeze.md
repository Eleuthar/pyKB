"""
Purpose: Package Python programs as standalone executables.
How It Works: Tools like PyInstaller or cx_Freeze allow you to bundle Python code and dependencies into a native executable for your platform, which can sometimes provide minor performance improvements, especially for startup time.
Best For: Creating executables or distributing code without requiring a Python interpreter.
