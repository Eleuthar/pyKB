"""
Allows Python to call C functions directly, enabling you to interface with C libraries for performance improvements.
How It Works: Use ctypes or CFFI to wrap C code or existing shared libraries (like .dll or .so files) and call them from Python.
Best For: Integrating low-level C code with Python for specific performance-critical sections.
"""

import ctypes

# Load the shared C library
lib = ctypes.CDLL('./mylib.so')

# Call a C function
result = lib.some_function(5)
print(result)
