Closures are an alternative to small classes, for hiding & encapsulating data.
A true closure must have an outer scope function var to be referenced by the inner.

"nonlocal" is used to store \ modify an outer scope immutable variable, excluding globals


# EXAMPLE 1
def make_counter():
    i = 0
    def counter(): # counter() is a closure
        nonlocal i
        i += 1
        return i
    return counter

c1 = make_counter()
c2 = make_counter()

print (c1(), c1(), c2(), c2())
# -> 1 2 1 2
