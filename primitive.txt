
LITERAL
```````
 ~ literals consist of string or number (integer, float, hexa, E)
 

 ~ if integer is prefixed with 0o or 0O, it is treated as octal number, therefore it must contain only digits from the 0-7 range, ex: 0o123 = 83
 
 
 ~ if the prefix is 0x, then it is treated as hexadecimal, ex: 0x123 = 291
 
 
 ~ scientific notation makes use of exponent: 3 * 10 ^ 8 = 3E8
 
 
 ~ print() will always convert from:
	* octal or hexadecimal to decimal
	* scientific to float.
